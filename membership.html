        To be part of the SiA-community, all you have to do is subscribe to our newsletter. But if you want to be an official club member,
        sign up and receive a membership card today! The card only cost 10 euros (used to produce and send the card) and with it you can 
        collect stamps for each participation. The longer you have been a member and the more events you have attended, the more priorities 
        you receive, such as special members only invites, and priority when an event has limited participations.
