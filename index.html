        <h1>SiA</h1>
        <h2>
            Time leaves its mark on all of us, shaping the way we see the world—and sometimes, the way the world sees us. 
            For long-term expats in Amsterdam, the city that once felt like an adventure can start to feel smaller, its streets more familiar, 
            its social circles harder to reshape. Like retirees who navigate the quiet spaces of life after work, seasoned expats, too, 
            can find themselves longing for new connections, fresh perspectives, and a reason to step beyond the routine.  
            <br><br>
            SiA is a gentle invitation to do just that. Inspired by the spirit of senior clubs, we organize day trips, 
            sightseeings, and small excursions—simple, unforced moments of discovery.  
            <br><br>
            There are no hidden fees, no obligations, just a Newsletter away from a new experience.
